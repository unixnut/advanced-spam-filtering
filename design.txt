A set of tools to set up iMAP-based user training for SpamAssassin, including
hooks for Horde's Ingo filter system.

== setup ==
ensure SpamAssassin is working
create spam, learn-spam and learn-notspam folders for all users and /etc/skel
if not using "mailbox_command = procmail" in /etc/postfix/main.cf, set up user forwards

== per-user preparation ==
install .procmailrc if necessary
check homedir permissions
run "setup_asf fred"
move any user-saved misclassified mail to appropriate folders
in MUA, subscribe to spam, learn-spam and learn-notspam folders
check inbox for spam
learn ham in inbox

== auto-Learning folders ==
cron job runs hourly to check if anything present
  learn spam in "learn-spam" (cur only)
  learn ham in "learn-notspam" (cur only) then move to inbox
  
cron job runs hourly (on the half hour) to move e-mail in "learn-spam" to spam
