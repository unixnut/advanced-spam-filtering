A set of tools to set up iMAP-based user training for SpamAssassin, including
hooks for Horde's Ingo filter system.

== setup ==
1) ensure SpamAssassin is working
2) run "make install"
3) alter /usr/local/etc/asf/conf.sh if necesssary

These instructions are mostly redundant; use setup_asf.
  create spam, learn-spam and learn-notspam folders for all users and /etc/skel
  if not using "mailbox_command = procmail" in /etc/postfix/main.cf, set up
  user forwards

== per-user preparation ==
1) install .procmailrc if necessary
2) check homedir permissions
3) run "setup_asf fred"
4) move any user-saved misclassified mail to appropriate folders
5) in MUA, subscribe to spam, learn-spam and learn-notspam folders
   (replace with folder names specified in /usr/local/etc/asf/conf.sh as necessary)
6) check inbox for spam
7) learn ham in inbox

== auto-Learning folders ==
cron job runs hourly to check if anything present
  learn spam in "learn-spam" (cur only)
  learn ham in "learn-notspam" (cur only) then move to inbox
  
cron job runs hourly (on the half hour) to move e-mail in "learn-spam" to spam
